/*User Stories (MVP)

As a user, I want a webpage that displays individual store data for my Salmon Cookie Shops, so that I can be informed about how to run my business
As a developer, I want to represent the store data in a list format on the webpage, so my client can view the information
As a developer, I want to use object-oriented programming to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand
Technical Requirements

Good use of Object Literals (no constructors allowed today); one for each store model; properties/values and methods are correctly constructed and given meaningful names
